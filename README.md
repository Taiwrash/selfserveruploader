## Introduction

Handling file uploads is a common task in web development, whether you're creating a platform for sharing images, managing documents, or any other application that requires users to upload files. SelfServerUploader streamlines this process and helps you get started quickly.

## Installation

To use SelfServerUploader in your Go application, follow these steps to install it:

```bash
go get github.com/Taiwrash/selfserveruploader
```

## Usage

Here's how you can use the SelfServerUploader package in your Fiber application:

1. Import the package:

   ```go
   import (
       "github.com/Taiwrash/selfserveruploader"
       "github.com/gofiber/fiber/v2"
   )
   ```

2. Set up a Fiber app:

   ```go
   app := fiber.New()
   ```

3. Use the `selfserveruploader.Upload` function as a middleware for handling file uploads:

   ```go
   app.Post("/upload", selfserveruploader.Upload)
   ```

   In this example, the `/upload` route is configured to handle file uploads.

4. Customize the upload behavior by modifying the `Upload` function as needed. You can specify file naming conventions, save locations, and more.

## Example

Here's a complete example of how to use the SelfServerUploader package in your Fiber application:

```go
package main

import (
    "github.com/gofiber/fiber/v2"
    "github.com/Taiwrash/selfserveruploader"
)

func main() {
    app := fiber.New()

    // Handle file uploads at the "/upload" endpoint
    app.Post("/upload", selfserveruploader.Upload)

    app.Listen(":4000")
}
```

Run the above code, and your Fiber application will be able to receive and save uploaded files.
